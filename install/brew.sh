#
# - Languages: ruby, lua, node, go, python, python3, r
# - C Compiler and debugger: gcc (6 & 4.9), gdb
# - Zsh: zsh, zsh-completions, z
# - Git: git, git-extras, git-lfs
# - Databases: Progres, MySQL, Redis, Mongo, Elasticsearch
# - Servers: Apache, Nginx
# - Fuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Correct your previous command. Note
#   that this needs to be added to zsh or bash. See the project README.
# - Foreman & Forego:
# - Tree (http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/): A directory listing utility
#   that produces a depth indented listing of files.
# - Tor ():
# - git-extras (https://vimeo.com/45506445): Adds a shit ton of useful commands #   to git.
# - autoenv (https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv): this utility makes it
#   easy to apply environment variables to projects. I mostly use it for Go and
#   Node.js projects. For Ruby projects, I just use Foreman or Forego.
# - autojump (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump): a faster way to navigate
#   your filesystem.
# Note that I install nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead
# of installing Node directly. This gives me more explicit control over
# which version I'm using.
